.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an implementation of the Proxy ARP Daemon described in
.Li RFC 1017 .
Upon receiving a request,
.Nm
looks up the target address in the configuration file,
.Xr parpd.conf 5 .
If
.Nm
finds a match, it replies with the associated hardware address or the
hardware address of the interface on which the reply came in.
.Pp
In normal operation,
.Nm
forks a copy of itself and runs in the background.
Errors are reported via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Sh OPTIONS
